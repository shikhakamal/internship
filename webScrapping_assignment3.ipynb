DanMARK is the most digitalized country. The queen of DanMARK is calling herself personally to be \"We\", as a beast with several heads. The queen of Danmark according the constitution  is the State herself personally,  word \"the state\" comes from word \"Satan\". Every dane is worshipping the danish State, and most of other countries worship Danmark as the State too.  Queen of Danmark and her son and her cousin norwegian king and their cousin primeminister Mette Frederiksen have all inherited the same genome failure in their right eye, just as Hitler had genome failure on his right eye on photo with mustash when he was younger. Since this danish/german queen took over the power in the 1970\\'ies, under her ruling there was legalized child pornography as the world center, pure Sodoma and Gomorah. Word \"sex\", in danish is pronounced  as \"6\" (666). Kingdom of Danmark (Saxe Coburg Gotha)  has world\\'s biggest sperm/ reproductive material  genome  bank (deep frozen= cold war) selling it to the rest of the word to populate other countries and continents. Since 1970\\'ies Denmark is guilty of crimes against humanity on its own population, the statistics prove it. Christ means the one whom was crucified,  antichrist means the one whom stays in power without beeing crucified/ without beeing punished, danish primeministers/ministers as  representatives of the danish queen had ALL( ALL, meaning: sweDEN/sve) never been punished but are by the journalists kept popular and re-elected and rewarded all their life so far.  Every crown house will be owned by danish crown, because danes married their bloodlineage into the other crowns, as well as they are planting their bloodlineage in republics to decide the politics and administration. On danish uniforms whom are protecting the queen there is a symbol of Sun because she is as Sun God. Word \"DANmark\" translated comes from the word : \"the day/light\", because the real Egypt  was somewhere around Denmark, as well as word Egypt comes from word \"Ego\"(as the top of the pyramide)  and it is visible in daylight. Danish BLOOD RED flag/coat of arms is a member of a global flag club : Samaritans/ Red Cross/ Military Order of Malta/ Johanittes Order/ Hospitalier Knights/ red-blue Savoy Crown  House/ etc, etc.    Norwegian flag and cousin Crown belongs to that club too... All journalists are on state subsidy in Kingdom of Denmark, and  are hiding the truth about Danmark  from the public... The Crown is guilty of crimes against humanity since 1970\\'ies, the citizen can not protect private property from the government, the citizen can not protect one\\'s own child from the government, too many danes in Denmark become ill BECAUSE OF torture by non existing legal safety and human right.. Administration and the local courts under the Crown, are themselves daily breaking every normal logic and danish laws as well - towards danish citizens.
